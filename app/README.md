# CoastalTools
CoastalTools provides a range of tools to load, manipulate and analyse wave, water level and beach profile data. 

## Licence
The code is provided as Open Source code (issued under a BSD 3-clause License).

## Requirements
CoastalTools is written in Matlab(TM) and requires v2016b, or later. In addition, CoastalTools requires both the _dstoolbox_ and the _muitoolbox_.

## Background
The CoastalTools package was developed to access and manipulate coastal data, such as held by the Channel Coastal Observatory (CCO) and the British Oceanographic Data Centre (BODC). CoastalTools provides a User Interface for time series data analysis, with many of the formats that are in routine use in the UK and elsewhere provided for in the data loading tools. A number of models that use the measured data are also provided. These provide the ability to estimate near shore wave parameters and properties that describe how the beaches are changing over time. The models generally use simple algorithms to transform the data and are notintended to be a substitute for more detailed coastal process modelling. The focus is very much on providing a means to rapidly explore the data that is now available from national archives.
