% * *Rivers>River Advection*: dialogue table to define river flow advection connectivity.
% * *Rivers>River Timeseries*: If there is more than one river input, user is prompted to select a river input channel. The user is then prompted for a text file with time series data to define river flow rates (which optionally can also include concentrations). 
% * *Rivers>Delete Input*: select the source to be deleted from the list of channels with river inputs.
%
% * *Drift>Drift  Inputs*: this component can only be added once some channel elements have been setup in the model. If no rivers are defined, the dialog box requires the Channel id number, along with the flow rate and the concentration density of the rivers sediment load.

%
% * *Hydraulics*: setup options when including idealised hydraulics in the model.

%% Run
% * *Check Input*: checks mass balance of any advection flows included and that sufficient components have been defined for the model to run. This is not a full diagnostic check, so it does not ensure that the model output is valid – simply that the model will run.
% * *Run Model*: runs model, prompts for a Case description, which is added to the listing on the Cases tab.
% * *Derive Output*: initialises the Derive Output UI to select and define manipulations of the data or call external functions and load the result as new data set.
