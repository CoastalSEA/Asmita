% A number of models are provided to illustrate a range of possible
% applications. The details of each model set-up are given in the 
% <matlab:open_manual manual>. The mat files for the demonstration models can be found in
% the example folder <matlab:example_folder here>. The models are:
%%
% * Humber 3EM - 3 element model of delta, channel and flat, including an
% intervention during the run period.
% * Venice 9EM - 9 element model comprising 3 inlets with channels, tidal
% flats and saltmarshes.
% * Severn 16EM - 16 element model of channels, flats and multiple river
% inputs. The model run includes tidal pumping.
% * Amelander 3EM2S - 3 element model of delta, channel and flat and including
% fine sediment for the tidal flats and coarse sediment for the delta and
% channel.
% * Inlet 7EMts - 7 element model comprising up and downdrift flats, flood and
% ebb delta, delta channel, main channel and inlet tidal flats. Model
% includes forcing with a time series of littoral drift rates.
